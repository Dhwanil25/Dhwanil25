Applied AI Systems Engineer | Multi-Agent LLM Research | Decision Intelligence  
MS Data Science @ George Washington University (Expected May 2026)

I build production-oriented AI systems that combine structured pipelines, retrieval, multi-agent coordination, and high-performance computing (HPC). My work focuses on reliability, failure modes, and decision-aware AI — not just model outputs.

## 🔬 Current Work

### 🧠 Multi-Agent LLM Systems
Researching coordination dynamics and instability in heterogeneous AI agents (El Farol–style environments) under Prof. Neil Johnson.  
Designing evaluation pipelines to study failure modes, bias propagation, and emergent behavior across open-source LLMs.

Focus Areas:
- Agent feedback loops
- GOOD/BAD labeling systems
- Instruction-policy adaptation
- Reinforcement learning-based simulations

---

### ⚙️ Production AI Sandbox (HPC + Slurm)
Built a browser-based AI sandbox platform enabling non-technical users to run generative AI models (ComfyUI, MusicGen) via:

- Slurm-based GPU scheduling (Cerberus & Pegasus clusters)
- Google Sheets → Orchestrator → ComfyUI pipelines
- Automated output delivery to Box & cloud storage
- SSO authentication & secure execution

Improved model execution performance by 50% through GPU-based orchestration.

### 🏪 Founder – RAIN (Retail Analytics & Intelligence Network)
Designing a multi-agent decision intelligence platform for independent grocery and mid-market retailers.

System Components:
- Inventory unification pipelines
- Supplier anomaly detection
- Risk-aware replenishment recommendations
- Demand-shift modeling
- Real-world customer discovery validation

## 🧠 Engineering Focus

I specialize in:

- LLM guardrails & structured JSON outputs
- Hybrid retrieval systems (BM25 + vector + reranking)
- Failure taxonomy & monitoring
- Geospatial aggregation (H3 indexing, spatial joins)
- HPC-based model orchestration
- Evaluation-driven AI development

## 🧭 Research Philosophy

AI systems fail in subtle ways.

My work focuses on:
- Identifying breakdown points in intelligent systems
- Designing evaluation pipelines before deployment
- Treating LLMs as probabilistic reasoning engines — not deterministic truth sources
