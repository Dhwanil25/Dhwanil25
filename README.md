Applied AI Systems Engineer | Multi-Agent LLM Research | Decision Intelligence  
MS Data Science @ George Washington University (Expected May 2026)

I build production-oriented AI systems that combine structured pipelines, retrieval, multi-agent coordination, and high-performance computing (HPC). My work focuses on reliability, failure modes, and decision-aware AI — not just model outputs.

## Current Work
- Researching multi-agent LLM coordination and failure modes (El Farol-style environments)
- Building HPC-powered AI sandbox (Slurm + GPU orchestration + secure pipelines)
- Founder of RAIN — a decision intelligence platform for retail inventory and supplier risk

## Focus Areas
- AI Research/ operational intelligence systems
- LLM guardrails & structured JSON outputs
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector + reranking)
- Failure taxonomy & monitoring
- HPC-based model orchestration

## 🧭 Research Philosophy

AI systems fail in subtle ways.

My work focuses on:
- Identifying breakdown points in intelligent systems
- Designing evaluation pipelines before deployment
- Treating LLMs as probabilistic reasoning engines — not deterministic truth sources
